# 11. Table of contents. Here's something for you to do in order to play around more with center, ljust, and rjust:
# write a program that will display a table of contents so that it looks like this:
# Table of Contents
#
# Chapter 1: Getting Started        page 1
# Chapter 2: Numbers                page 9
# Chapter 3: Letters                page 13

# for every row in rows
for r in rows:
    # print the first word of the row leaving empty spaces to fill up the column width and then print the second element
    print(r[0].ljust(col_width) + r[1])


# 12. Write a program that prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic, "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
# source http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html
starter_num = 99

# print the lyrics title
print("\n", (" Lyrics of the song %s Bottles of Beer " % starter_num).center(50, "🍺"), "\n")

# 13. Deaf grandma.
# Whatever you say to Grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with this: HUH?! SPEAK UP, GIRL!
# unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back:
# NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
# To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout a different year each time,
# maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.
# You can’t stop talking to Grandma until you shout BYE.
print()
tell_grandma = ""

while tell_grandma != "BYE":
    tell_grandma = input("Tell something to Grandma: ")
    # if tell_grandma.isupper() and not tell_grandma.islower():   =>  this would be semantically more correct however
    # I think that the above method will scan the string tell_grandma twice whilst the one below only once
    if tell_grandma == tell_grandma.upper():
        random_year = randint(1930, 1950)
        print("NO, NOT SINCE %s" % random_year)
    else:
        print("HUH?! SPEAK UP, GIRL!")


# 14. Deaf grandma extended. What if Grandma doesn't want you to leave?
# When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you.
# Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row.
# Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.


# 15. Leap years.
# Write a program that asks for a starting year and an ending year and
# then puts all the leap years between them (and including them,
# if they are also leap years). Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004).
# However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900)
# unless they are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years). What a mess!


# 16. Find something today in your life, that is a calculation.
# Go for a walk, look around the park, try to count something.
# Anything! And write a program about it. e.g. number of stairs, steps, windows,
# leaves estimated in the park, kids, dogs, estimate your books by bookshelf, toiletries, wardrobe.


# 17. Building and sorting an array. Write the program that asks us to type as many words as we want
# (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line)
# and then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program thoroughly; for example,
# does hitting Enter on an empty line always exit your program? Even on the first line? And the second?
# Hint: There’s a lovely array method that will give you a sorted version of an array: sorted(). Use it!


# 18. Table of contents. Write a table of contents program here.
# Start the program with a list holding all of the information for your table of contents
# (chapter names, page numbers, and so on).
# Then print out the information from the list in a beautifully formatted table of contents.
# Use string formatting such as left align, right align, center.


# 19. Old-school Roman numerals. In the early days of Roman numerals,
# the Romans didn't bother with any of this new-fangled subtraction “IX” nonsense.
# No Mylady, it was straight addition, biggest to littlest—so 9 was written “VIIII,” and so on.


# 20. Write a method that when passed an integer between 1 and 3000 (or so)
# returns a string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral.
# In other words, old_roman_numeral 4 should return 'IIII'.
# Make sure to test your method on a bunch of different numbers.
# Hint: Use the integer division and modulus methods.
# For reference, these are the values of the letters used:
# I = 1
# V = 5
# X = 10
# L = 50
# C = 100
# D = 500
# M = 1000


# 21. “Modern” Roman numerals.
# Eventually, someone thought it would be terribly clever if putting a smaller number before a larger one meant you
# had to subtract the smaller one. As a result of this development, you must now suffer.
# Rewrite your previous method to return the new-style Roman numerals so when someone calls roman_numeral 4,
# it should return 'IV', 90 should be 'XC' etc.
