# 1 Million Women To Tech #SummerOfCode

## Week 12 GitHub - A gentle introduction to collaboration using GitHub

This hackathon can be entered and won (!) without coding knowledge. Using the lessons from this week you have learned how to create markdown files (.md) and how to include images in them (Day 2).

Deadline: Monday 12 pm noon, Oct 8th, 2018.

### Challenge

The challenge is to create beautiful HOWTOs, or visual walk-through guides that would be helpful to the 1 Million Women To Tech Sisterhood. Do you remember Vanessa Dunford's amazing HOWTO during Blockchain week? We are looking for similarly high quality, fun, kind, and beautiful HOWTOs. 

See her creation here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzbB_b0s7W79Doh9YmvKiArSXfyxjAVE/view

This is however in PDF so it's not editable, plus we keep most of our code on GitHub so we ask that you use GitHub Flavoured Markdown and images as we saw during Day 2 this week.

Q: Who is eligible to participate?
A: Everyone. Both VIP, Gold and DIY members, as always. Please note that as VIP and Gold members you also have access to the DIY portal. It's just a different password probably, but the same email username. So if you would like to take screen shots from within the DIY memberportal you can do so. https://memberportal.1millionwomentotech.com/diy-login/

### Prizes:

Top 3 contributors receive a free ticket to GitHub Universe · Oct 16 - 17, 2018 · San Francisco, CA
https://githubuniverse.com/get-tickets/

This is a two-day conference with wonderful workshops, networking, and speakers and costs $599.

Q: How will you measure who is the top contributor?
A: Those who sent the most number of high quality Pull Requests. It is better to send just one Pull Request that is free from typos, funny, and beautiful, than three Pull Requests that require the Volunteers and myself to spend a lot of time asking for revisions.

### How to win

Fork
https://github.com/1millionwomentotech/toolkitten

1. Make walk-throughs in Markdown with screenshots
2. Put your .md files inside `/toolkitten/howto`
3. Put the images (.jpg/.png) inside `/toolkitten/howto/images` 

As seen on Day 2.

### Deadline Oct 8, 2018

Pull Requests should be at merge quality by **Monday 12 pm noon, Oct 8th, 2018**. You can open them beforehand any time, but please keep sending commits and perfecting until Monday noon.

This should give everyone the weekend to work on it as we announced it only today on Day 3.

### How to avoid duplication of effort

When you have an idea, please open an issue on `toolkitten` describing the HOWTO that you are writing.

https://github.com/1millionwomentotech/toolkitten/issues > `New issue` button

Start the issue title with `HOWTO` all capital and describe what you are proposing.

When working, you can assign an issue to yourself to show others that someone is working on it already. You can also add a comment below the issue to explain what you are planning and when.

Then in your Pull Request reference the issue with the `#` sign e.g. `#334`.

See the end of Day 3 video.

### Cannot come to San Francisco?

This month is also Hacktoberfest! This is a global hacking initiative to bring more people into open source. 

`toolkitten` is eligible as Open Source project, so if you sign up for Hacktoberfest and then open 5 pull requests, you become eligible to get a t-shirt!

Q: Can I just open any random 5 pull requests?
A: Please don't. Instead, think of 5 HOWTOs that would help the community, make the issues and then send PRs with reference to them. ;)
