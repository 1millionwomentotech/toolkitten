# 1 Million Women To Tech #SummerOfCode

## Week 12 GitHub - A gentle introduction to collaboration using GitHub

## Day 2

### Writing good commit messages

A commit message consists of 3 parts:
- shortlog
- commit body
- issue reference

Usually the Git book is referenced: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project but I prefer Angular style where you DON'T capitalize.

Angular's commit message conventions are nice and detailed:

Contribution guidelines include a bot to sign license agreement:
- https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-signing-the-cla

React's are not
