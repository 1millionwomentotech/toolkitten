# 1 Million Women To Tech 

## Week 12 GitHub - A gentle introduction to collaboration using GitHub

Has this ever happened to you? Trying to use Git but not so clear on how to learn?

In the words of a GitHub Labs learner:

> I have been trying to learn Git + GitHub to start teaching at the school. Without understanding the correct use, and potential problems that we could face when using this technology I am not so confident to do it.
> Yet, I have finished the Udacity course, a course with a campus expert, and again and again the problem is the nature of the examples. At some point, they lose attention to the learning curve and start using complex examples that does not make any sense at all, thus the problem is not about using GitHub but to figure out where an error or diff is present.

Therefore this week we will go through every click, every screen, from the moment of signing up for a GitHub account to setting up our Git software, to contributing regularly. I will be demoing using the following:
- Mac
- GitHub account
- iTerm2
- git (comes with XCode)
- gitKraken

## Setup

1. Sign up for a GitHub account
2. Install gitKraken
3. Make sure you have git installed on your machine

## Workflow

Thatâ€™s all there is to it. The fundamentals are:
1. Fork the project & clone locally.
2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
3. Branch for each separate piece of work.
4. Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
5. Push to your origin repository.
6. Create a new PR in GitHub.
7. Respond to any code review feedback.

If you want to contribute to an open source project, the best one to pick is one that you are using yourself. The maintainers will appreciate it!

## Day 1

### How to Write Good Commit Messages

A commit message consists of 3 parts:
- shortlog
- commit body
- issue reference

Usually the Git book is referenced: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project but I prefer Angular style where you DON'T capitalize.

Angular's commit message conventions are nice and detailed:

Contribution guidelines include a bot to sign license agreement:
- https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-signing-the-cla

React's are not

It sounds fancier than it is.
