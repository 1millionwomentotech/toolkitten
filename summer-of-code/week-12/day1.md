# 1 Million Women To Tech #SummerOfCode

## Week 12 GitHub - A gentle introduction to collaboration using GitHub

## Day 1

### Sign-up

Remember to use your real name, first name and last name if you are planning to get a job or freelance. Don't use your year of birth.

If you are into a subculture such as VR or gaming, then of course you may want to keep your username from those worlds.

So think about how you want to represent yourself to the world. If you are a career changer and it is your first time on GitHub I recommend `firstnamelastname`, for me it is `ilonabudapesti`.

### Course

We did the first course from [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) today.

- Find one open source project on GitHub that excites you and be ready to share the URL to their repo tomorrow: DIYers are always welcome to come to the daily teaser at 9:00am BST and interact with myself and others. Bring your links and see you there!

### Optional

If you are more advanced, and only then, you can read up on the git branching model I briefly showed today:

Look into how to make GitHub slideshows, GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Here is one interesting service to get you started:
