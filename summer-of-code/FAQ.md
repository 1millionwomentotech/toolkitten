## Kind of mentors

We are looking for passionate volunteers who are fluent in English and have expert knowledge in at least one of the following areas: JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, or Blockchain. Furthermore, since most of our participants are completely new to coding, it would be great if you were a person who is kind, patient, and positive in the feedback you provide! All genders are welcome to mentor, although we want to particularly encourage women and enbies.

## Benefits of mentoring

Most importantly, the opportunity to be part of something great and make a difference! We are absolutely overwhelmed by much interest the 1 Million Women To Tech: Summer of Code has received so far, with over 20,000 pre-registrations from over 140 different countries all around the world. Since we are a non-profit and this is our first Summer of Code, unfortunately we will not be able to accept all of these candidates, as much as we would like to. The more mentors are willing to contribute, the more women will be able to receive personalized guidance on their journey into coding: therefore the project stands and falls with your support! We believe that this is an exciting opportunity to make a difference and start bridging the gender gap in the tech sector!

You will also receive a Leadership Certificate from Oxford Entrepreneurs, and be able to put a really cool item on your CV!

## Time commitment

We ask for at least two hours each weekday (Monday to Friday), for at least one full week. (If you can do even more than one week, we will be extremely grateful!) You can select which times of the day work best for you: as our participants come from all around the world, someone will be online and needing help all around the clock.

When checking your availability, we recommend that you also make sure that your skill set matches the Summer of Code program in the week when you are planning to volunteer:

|Week | Topic |
|---|--- |
|July 16 - 20	| Introductory Python|
|July 23 - 27	|	Advanced Python|
|July 30 - August 3 |	Natural Language Processing with Python|
|August 6 - 10 | Artificial Intelligence with Python & Tensorflow|
|August 13 - 17	|	Introductory JavaScript|
|August 20 - 24	|	Advanced JavaScript|
|August 27 - 31	 | Mobile Prototyping (UI/UX) in InvisionApp|
|September 3 - 7 | Mobile App Development with React.JS|
|September 10 - 14 | Blockchain|
|September 17 - 21 | Virtual Reality|
|September 24 - 28 | Augmented Reality|
|October 1 - 5 | TBD (best suited for senior developers with a broad skill set)|

## Mentoring entails

We ask you to be available for 2 hours each weekday for answering participants’ questions about the current week’s syllabus and coding challenges across the following channels.

`Slack`: Some mentors will be asked to staff our Slack support channel and answer questions in real time via chat.

`Help tickets`: We operate a help desk where the participants can create support tickets, which we will ask the mentors to answer.

`StackOverflow`: Additionally we will create a special hashtag for participants asking coding questions on StackOverflow, and we will ask some of our mentors to watch out for these tags and take care of the questions.

If you have prior experience mentoring in hackathons or courses, especially in online environments, we would welcome your ideas, suggestions, or even your help coordinating the mentoring process.

## Onboarding process

We are offering a webinar on Sunday, July 8, 4 pm BST (15:00 UTC) to everybody who expresses their interest to mentor. We would ask all prospective mentors to watch this webinar (ideally live, or later via replay). After watching this webinar, you will then be invited to our slack channel where we will discuss all the details.
