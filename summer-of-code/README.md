# Hackathons

Throughout the Summer of Code there are 12 weekly hackathons, 3 monthly hackathons, and 1 all-summer hackathon. Participants may enter one or more.

The weekly hackathons follow the theme of the week's course module so Week 1 is "Introduction to Python", and the hackathon is for entry level Python hacks, and so on.

The monthly hackathon's follow the tracks so Month 1 hackathon is for Python hacks, Month 2 for JavaScript hacks, and Month 3 for all the AR, VR, and Blockchain hacks.

The all-summer hackathon is an open category so that those who have a project in mind can use the Summer of Code as an opportunity to develop their idea into a prototype or even an MVP and have a chance to showcase it.

### Week 7

August 27 - 31  Self-care Week

Naming credits :)

Virginia Balseiro Self-care week

Gillian Newton​ "Week of Sanity" "Week of Empowerment", "Re-factor Your Code"
Krystal​ Re-Code Week?
Catch-up week (Ketchup week)
Paula Bernal Inner Coding Week
Bituin Callanta​ Recalibration Week

The first benefit of a self-care week is that you have time for yourself and your coding.

There will be **NO** classes during this week, however, you are welcome to continue on material from previous weeks or to study ahead.

The second benefit is that the deadlines of the Week 6 hackathon and the Month 2 hackathon to reflect the addition of a week's time.

The third benefit is that Week 8 will be the mobile app prototyping week and you will have until Week 13 to giving you 5 weeks instead of just 1 week polish your mobile app, and work on your JavaScript skills before we dive into React.js. This is perhaps the greatest benefit.
