<h2>Homework</h2>

<h3>Week 5</h3>

<h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">Day 1</h4>

<p>
  Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year? <div id="q1"></div>
</p>

<p>
  Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade? <div id="q2"></div>
</p>

<p>
  Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? <div id="q3"></div>
</p>

<p>
  Cristina Tarantino: 32 yesterday! How many milliseconds old is she? <div id="q4"></div>
</p>

<p>
  How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it 
  has a bug with integer overflow? <div id="q5"></div>
</p>

<p>
  How about a 64-bit system? <div id="q6"></div>
</p>

<p>
  Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday 
  (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - 
  you will need JavaScript DateTime functionality. 
  <br /> 
  <table>
       <tr>
          <td>Years:<div id="q7y"></div></td>
          <td>Months: <div id="q7m"></div></td>
          <td>Days: <div id="q7d"></div></td>
       </tr>
    </table>
 
</p>


<h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">Day 2</h4>

<p>
Music
  A 440 Hz
  1 octave is double the frequency
  tempered piano
  A' 880 Hz
  Calculate and console.log the frequency each of the 12 notes between A and A'
  Hint: the notes are NOT in a linear scale, but in a geometric scale

Planets
  Calculate and console log how many 'minutes' the Moon travels in a day.
  Hint: first calculate how many degrees the Moons travels in the sky when 
  the Earth returns to the same position during its daily rotation.
  <div id="q9"></div>
</p>
  

<!--The Moon moves around the Earth in an approximately circular orbit,
going once around us in approximately 27.3 days, or one sidereal period of revolution.
Since there are 360 degrees in a circle, the Moon moves (on the average) 
360 / 27.3 or 13.2 degrees per day relative to the stars, 
which is just over half a degree per hour, and approximately equal to its apparent size.

<h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">Day 3</h4>
<p>
Full name greeting. </br>
Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last. 
Finally, it should greet the person using their full name. 
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Welcome to 1mwtt</b></td>
      <td><div id="q10"></div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Bigger, better favorite number.</br> 
Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number. 
Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and 
better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.) 
</p>

<p>
Angry boss. </br>
Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. 
Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. 
For example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this: 
```
WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!
``` 
</p>

<p>
Table of contents. </br>
Here’s something for you to do in order to play 
around more with center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will display 
a table of contents so that it looks like this: </br>

Table of Contents </br>
     
Chapter 1: Getting Started        page 1</br>
Chapter 2: Numbers                page 9</br>
Chapter 3: Letters                page 13</br>

Optional: in JS we may prefer to 'print' these to the HTML file itself 
    rather than the console.

<p id="title"><b>Table of Contents:</b></p></br>

<p>
  <div id="ch1" style="display:inline; float:left; width:200px;">Chapter 1: Getting Started</div>
  <div id="pg1" style="display:inline;">page 1</div>
</p>


<p>
<div id="ch2" style="display:inline; float:left; width:200px;">Chapter 2: Numbers</div>
<div id="pg2" style="display:inline-block;">page 9</div></p>

<p>
<div id="ch3" style="display:inline; float:left; width:200px;">Chapter 3: Letters</div>
<div id="pg3" style="display:inline-block;">page 13</div></p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Align table of content</button>    
</p>

  
<p>Random number between 1 and 10? <div id="rand1"></div></p>
<p>Random number between 1 and 100? <div id="rand2"></div></p>
<p>Random number between 1930 and 1950? <div id="rand3"></div></p>

<p>
  Then try to generate your random Civilization III world by generating a land 'X' 
  tile or a water 'o' tile randomly:

  - oooXXXoo
  - oooXoXoo
  - XXXooXoo
