	<h1>Week 5 homework</h1>
	<h2 id='day1' style="color: blue"></h2>
	<p>Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?</p>
	<div id="day1Ex1"></div>
	<p>Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?</p>
	<div id="day1Ex2"></div>
	<p>Cristina Tarantino: 32 yesterday! How many milliseconds old is she hahaha? Calculate @Cristina Tarantino's age in milliseconds.</p>
	<div id="day1Ex3"></div>
	<p>How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?</p>
	<div id="day1Ex4"></div>
	<p>How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?</p>
	<div id="day1Ex5"></div>
	<p>Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need JavaScript DateTime functionality.</p>
	<div id="day1Ex6"></div>
	<h2 id='day2' style="color: blue"></h2>
	<p>Music A 440 Hz 1 octave is double the frequency tempered piano A' 880 Hz Calculate and console.log the frequency each of the 12 notes between A and A' Hint: the notes are NOT in a linear scale, but in a geometric scale</p>
	<div id="day2Ex1"></div>
	<p>Planets Calculate and console log how many 'minutes' the Moon travels in a day. Hint: first calculate how many degrees the Moons travels in the sky when the Earth returns to the same position during its daily rotation.</p>
	<div id="day2Ex2"></div>
	<h2 id='day3' style="color: blue"></h2>
	<p>Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.</p>
	<button id='day3Ex1' onclick="day3Ex1()">Click me</button>
	<p>Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)</p>
	<button id='day3Ex2' onclick="day3Ex2()">Click me</button>
	<p>Angry boss. Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
     WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!</p>
     <button id='day3Ex3' onclick="day3Ex3()">Click me</button>
      <p>Table of contents. Here’s something for you to do in order to play around more with center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will display a table of contents so that it looks like this:
		Table of Contents

		Chapter 1: Getting Started page 1 Chapter 2: Numbers page 9 Chapter 3: Letters page 13

		Optional: in JS we may prefer to 'print' these to the HTML file itself rather than the console.</p>
	<div id="day3Ex4"></div>
	<p>More Arithmetic - Optional  </p>
	<p> pow(5, 10)</p>
	<div id="day3ExO1"></div>
	<p> 365%7</p>
	<div id="day3ExO2"></div>
	<p> abs(-7)</p>
	<div id="day3ExO3"></div>
	<p>Random Numbers - Optional</p>
	<p>Research how to generate a random number with JavaScript. (Math.random() will output a random number from 0 up to but not including 1)

Generate a random number</p>
<p>between 1 and 10</p>
<div id="day3ExO4"></div>
<p>between 1 and 100</p>
<div id="day3ExO5"></div>
<p>between 1930 and 1950</p>
<div id="day3ExO6"></div>
<p>Then try to generate your random Civilization III world by generating a land 'X' tile or a water 'o' tile randomly:

oooXXXoo
oooXoXoo
XXXooXoo</p>
<button onclick="day3ExO7()">Generate world</button>

<h2 id='day4' style="color: blue"></h2>
<p>“99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.” Write a program that prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic, “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.”</p>
<div id="day4Ex1"></div>
<p>Deaf grandma. Whatever you say to Grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with this: HUH?! SPEAK UP, GIRL!

unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back:

NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout a different year each time, maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. (This part is optional and would be much easier if you read the section on JavaScript’s random number generator under the Math Object.) You can’t stop talking to Grandma until you shout BYE.

Deaf grandma extended. What if Grandma doesn’t want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.

Leap years. Write a program that asks for a starting year and an ending year and then puts all the leap years between them (and including them, if they are also leap years). Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years). What a mess!</p>

<button onclick="day4Ex2()">Click me</button>

<p>Building and sorting an array. Write the program that asks us to type as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program thoroughly; for example, does hitting Enter on an empty line always exit your program? Even on the first line? And the second?</p>

<button onclick="day4Ex3()">Click me</button>

<p>Write a function that prints out "moo" n times.</p>

<button onclick="day4Ex5()">Click me</button>

<p>Old-school Roman numerals. In the early days of Roman numerals, the Romans didn’t bother with any of this new-fangled subtraction “IX” nonsense.
No Mylady, it was straight addition, biggest to littlest—so 9 was written “VIIII,” and so on.

Write a method that when passed an integer between 1 and 3000 (or so) returns a string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral. In other words, old_roman_numeral 4 should return 'IIII'. Make sure to test your method on a bunch of different numbers.

Hint: Use the integer division and modulus methods.

For reference, these are the values of the letters used: I = 1 V = 5 X = 10
L = 50 C = 100 D = 500 M = 1000</p>

</div>

<p>“Modern” Roman numerals. Eventually, someone thought it would be terribly clever if putting a smaller number before a larger one meant you had to subtract the smaller one. As a result of this development, you must now suffer. Rewrite your previous method to return the new-style Roman numerals so when someone calls roman_numeral 4, it should return 'IV', 90 should be 'XC' etc.</p>
