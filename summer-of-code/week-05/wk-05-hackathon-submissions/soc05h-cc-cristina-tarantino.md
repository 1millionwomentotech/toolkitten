### Week 5 Hackathon Challenge: Continent Counter JS

The JavaScript file is `soc05h-cc-cristina-tarantino.js` and `Game.model` contains the actual code.

The `Game.view` object only helps the html file to be a bit dynamic and show the world in a UI friendly way.

I only had 1 day to do the hackathon and my plan was to make it interactive and provide tests.
Due to lack of time I have not been able to finish the project to a standard that was acceptable from a UI point of you.
Stepts to get the html working.

 1. Open the `soc05h-cc-cristina-tarantino.html` page in Chrome. You will be prompted to specify at least the Width of the World.
 2. Enter the width of the world to a max of 20.
 2. Click Submit.
 3. You will be prompted with the world representation; Click on Count Continents button.
 4. You will se under the world representation the list on continents and the top 2 largest.
