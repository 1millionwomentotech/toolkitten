### Homework
- Install Solidity - choose your own sources, here are some ideas to get you started:
  - https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html
  - https://walkingtree.tech/setting-ethereum-development-environment-macos/
  - https://medium.com/edgefund/ethereum-development-on-windows-part-1-da260f6a6c06
  - https://medium.com/@wslyvh/get-started-with-ethereum-solidity-on-windows-1672e9953a1
- Read **THE** Ethereum Whitepaper
  - https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper

### Optional homework
- Finish the voting example (in Remix is fine, Remix is the browser based IDE) and suggest improvements: Currently, many transactions are needed to assign the rights to vote to all participants. Can you think of a better way?
- Add tests to the voting example
