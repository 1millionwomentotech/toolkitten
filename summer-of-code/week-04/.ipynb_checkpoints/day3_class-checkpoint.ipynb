      "I did hours of research on strollers... contemplating between the First Years Indigo and theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I finally settled on the Indigo stroller because the price was right and the features I wanted were all there. I purchased the stroller and matchingThe First Years Via Infant Car Seat, Abstract O'scar seat. My son was born in the winter and I didn't use the Indigo stroller regularly until about two months ago. For the first week, the stroller was wonderful. What I had initially liked most about the stroller was that I could easily attach the matching First Years Via car seat. In addition, the ride was smooth, quiet, and comfy. The stroller was a breeze to fold. Then, about two weeks into regular use, I started to notice the quality of the stroller diminish quickly. Here is what started to happen:(1) SQUEAKY WHEELS. The wheels started squeaking terribly. I'd oil them and within a few days the stroller was squeaking again! I'd be in a store and people would turn there heads to see who had the annoyingly loud stroller.(2) VIA CAR SEAT WOULD GET CAUGHT. This is what really bothered me. I could live with the squeaking, but this I could not. My son is 6 months old and we still use the infant car seat regularly. One day the car seat began to get stuck inside the left car seat stroller locking mechanism. We thought maybe it was our son's weight causing the problem, so we took him out of the car seat and tried again. No luck! We still couldn't get the car seat out. After fidgeting with the stroller and car seat for nearly 30minutes, we finally got the car seat unstuck! To test things out to see whether or not it was the stroller or car seat causing the problem, we decided to attached seat that came with the stroller. That too would get stuck and we wrestled around with it until it miraculously came unstuck.Unfortunately, this stroller just had to be returned (thank goodness for Amazon's 365 day return policy on baby items). As much as I liked its other features, I couldn't put up with its defective qualities. Perhaps I received a defective stroller AND car seat but I find that really hard to believe.In addition to it being defective, here is what else I didn't like about the stroller.(1) BULKY. I knew when I purchased this stroller that it would be a standard size stroller but I still feel it was unnecessarily bulky. In order to fold it up, you have to remove the seat and then fold up the frame. Before I had my son I didn't think this was a big deal. Now I know better. I'd recommend you find a one piece fold-up stroller like the Bumbleride Flyer.(2) NO CUPHOLDERS. There are no cup holders for the child or adult using the stroller. At the time I purchased the stroller, there were also no accessories available that could attach to the stroller. I think this is the huge oversight.(3) SEAT HAD TO BE REMOVED. I really found it annoying that I had to remove the seat in order to collapse the stroller or switch the stroller from back to forward facing. As I said earlier, I initially thought this was a frivolous disadvantage but I now think otherwise. Other strollers that have the same back to forward facing option allow you to simply switch the direction of the handles without having to remove the seat. If First Years ever redesigns this stroller, they should include that option in their redesign.Even though I decided to return the stroller, there are still some qualities that I liked about this stroller. Here is what I liked:(1) BACK AND FORWARD FACING. I loved that I could face my son towards me when he was an infant and away from me when he gets old enough that he wanted to explore.(2) EASY TO COLLAPSE. Although the stroller was bulky, the stroller was still a breeze to collapse.(3) EUROPEAN STYLING. In addition the practicality, I was looking for a European styled stroller. This is the most affordable stroller that is also stylish.After I returned the First Years Indigo Stroller, I went ahead and purchased theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I will update this review in the near future with a comparison of the two after I get more use of theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. If you can afford to splurge on the Bumbleride Flyer, I would highly recommend it.\n"

      "I did hours of research on strollers... contemplating between the First Years Indigo and theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I finally settled on the Indigo stroller because the price was right and the features I wanted were all there. I purchased the stroller and matchingThe First Years Via Infant Car Seat, Abstract O'scar seat. My son was born in the winter and I didn't use the Indigo stroller regularly until about two months ago. For the first week, the stroller was wonderful. What I had initially liked most about the stroller was that I could easily attach the matching First Years Via car seat. In addition, the ride was smooth, quiet, and comfy. The stroller was a breeze to fold. Then, about two weeks into regular use, I started to notice the quality of the stroller diminish quickly. Here is what started to happen:(1) SQUEAKY WHEELS. The wheels started squeaking terribly. I'd oil them and within a few days the stroller was squeaking again! I'd be in a store and people would turn there heads to see who had the annoyingly loud stroller.(2) VIA CAR SEAT WOULD GET CAUGHT. This is what really bothered me. I could live with the squeaking, but this I could not. My son is 6 months old and we still use the infant car seat regularly. One day the car seat began to get stuck inside the left car seat stroller locking mechanism. We thought maybe it was our son's weight causing the problem, so we took him out of the car seat and tried again. No luck! We still couldn't get the car seat out. After fidgeting with the stroller and car seat for nearly 30minutes, we finally got the car seat unstuck! To test things out to see whether or not it was the stroller or car seat causing the problem, we decided to attached seat that came with the stroller. That too would get stuck and we wrestled around with it until it miraculously came unstuck.Unfortunately, this stroller just had to be returned (thank goodness for Amazon's 365 day return policy on baby items). As much as I liked its other features, I couldn't put up with its defective qualities. Perhaps I received a defective stroller AND car seat but I find that really hard to believe.In addition to it being defective, here is what else I didn't like about the stroller.(1) BULKY. I knew when I purchased this stroller that it would be a standard size stroller but I still feel it was unnecessarily bulky. In order to fold it up, you have to remove the seat and then fold up the frame. Before I had my son I didn't think this was a big deal. Now I know better. I'd recommend you find a one piece fold-up stroller like the Bumbleride Flyer.(2) NO CUPHOLDERS. There are no cup holders for the child or adult using the stroller. At the time I purchased the stroller, there were also no accessories available that could attach to the stroller. I think this is the huge oversight.(3) SEAT HAD TO BE REMOVED. I really found it annoying that I had to remove the seat in order to collapse the stroller or switch the stroller from back to forward facing. As I said earlier, I initially thought this was a frivolous disadvantage but I now think otherwise. Other strollers that have the same back to forward facing option allow you to simply switch the direction of the handles without having to remove the seat. If First Years ever redesigns this stroller, they should include that option in their redesign.Even though I decided to return the stroller, there are still some qualities that I liked about this stroller. Here is what I liked:(1) BACK AND FORWARD FACING. I loved that I could face my son towards me when he was an infant and away from me when he gets old enough that he wanted to explore.(2) EASY TO COLLAPSE. Although the stroller was bulky, the stroller was still a breeze to collapse.(3) EUROPEAN STYLING. In addition the practicality, I was looking for a European styled stroller. This is the most affordable stroller that is also stylish.After I returned the First Years Indigo Stroller, I went ahead and purchased theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I will update this review in the near future with a comparison of the two after I get more use of theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. If you can afford to splurge on the Bumbleride Flyer, I would highly recommend it.\n"
