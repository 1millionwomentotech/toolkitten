    "# Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will learn to build a very simple sentiment predictor, which will allow us to forecast the rating of short product reviews on a scale from very positive (5 stars) to very negative (1 star), based on the content of the text only: we will pretend that we can only see the text, and try if we can predict how many stars the user gave the product based on its tone. This is a useful exercise for situations in which we don't have a \"star rating\" easily available. For example, if we are running our own business, many users will probably write tweets or Facebook posts in which they state their opinion of the business, and we want to be able to quickly sort the good from the bad reviews.\n",

    "For this project, we start by setting up our Python environment, and downloading a couple of example datasets (Amazon product reviews) from the Internet. These data were collected by Julian McAuley, UCSD (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).\n"

I love that all I have to do is pump it and add a nipple and its ready to go and its also easier to store than regular breastmilk bags from medela and its also less expensive also.

    "We see that the dataset contains 160792 data items, with 9 fields called `reviewTime, asin, reviewerID, reviewText, unixReviewTime, summary, helpful, reviewerName, overall`. For example, this particular review was written on May 20, 2005, by the user 'Erin White \"Erin\"'. Erin summarized the product as \"Has more comforts than Medela!\" and gave it 5 stars (out of 5). 7 out of 8 other users rated this review helpful. We also added a hash, which is a single number summarizing the whole data item. For now we can view it as a random ID that is (extremely likely to be) unique for each data item, a bit like a US social security number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will ignore all fields except reviewText and overall (i.e. the overall rating in stars out of five). The idea is to find out if we can infer the star rating (how much the user liked the product) by only looking at the text. This way we can learn how to automatically analyze even texts that come without a star rating, such as Facebook posts or tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start building a complicated AI solution, it is good practice to first implement a very simple \"baseline predictor\" and measure its performance. This way we get a feeling how hard (or easy) the problem is, For example, we can check for the presence of certain words with strong positive or negative connotations, such as \"good\" or \"fantastic\" versus \"bad\" or \"poor\". Note that this review contains the words \"horrible\", \"hurt\", \"bad\" and \"problem\", and still received 5 stars. This gives us already a feeling for the difficulty of the sentiment analysis problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we develop our first sentiment predictor, we need to partition our data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This is something we should do in all our machine learning projects. The idea is that our predictor might overgeneralize from the examples we show it if we are not careful. This is a bit like a child whom you have shown how an iPad works, and then they try to swipe everything that looks like a screen (the TV, the microwave etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the example review listed above might be the only review with the phrase \"6 hours\" in it, and our predictor might learn a rule that the phrase \"6 hours\" is indicative of a high star rating. Such a rule would be unlikely to generalize well to new reviews that we didn't show to the predictor while it was training. So after training our predictor (using only examples from the training set), we need to be able to measure its performance on reviews it hasn't seen yet, which is what the test set is for. We use the validation set because we may want to explore different predictor variants and get an idea how well they perform on unseen examples before committing to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the general procedure when developing a predictor using machine learning is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train several variants of a predictor using examples from the training set only.\n",
    "Use the predictor performance on the validation set to select a single best predictor among all the possible variants. This step also involves debugging our implementation of the predictor, tweaking its parameters etc.\n",
    "Use the test set to get an idea how well our best predictor is expected to perform on unseen data. This step should only be performed once, at the very end of the experiment: if we tweak our predictor based on its performance on the test set, we simply may find a variant that \"gets lucky\" on the test set, and overestimate its accuracy on truly unseen examples.\n",
    "A common rule of thumb is to use 60% of our data for the training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. We could simply take the first 60% of our review data for training, but then we have to assume that the dataset has been \"mixed\" well in advance. We achieve a better randomization by using the hash we computed from the JSON string and checking its modulus 10:\n"

    "Prediction algorithms generally work with numbers instead of text. Therefore we need to preprocess our text by extracting from it numeric \"features\" that we can afterwards feed into our predictor. For our simple baseline predictor, we will use only two features: the frequency of positive words in the review (\"good\", \"great\", \"like\") and the frequency of negative words in the review (\"bad\", \"horrible\", \"dislike\"). Let's call these two features **fpos** and **fneg**. Our hypothesis is that reviews with many positive words (high fpos) are likely to receive 4 or 5 stars, while reviews with many negative words (high fneg) will probably receive 1 or 2 stars. Since reviews differ in their length, it makes sense to express the frequency of positive and negative words as a fraction of the total number of words in the review. Therefore fpos and fneg will be numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume the review text is \"This is a good, great, fantastic, amazing, wonderful, super product!\". We count six positive words and zero negative words (out of ten words in total), so fpos == 0.6 (6/10) and fneg == 0.0 (0/10). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the review \"This is a bad, atrocious, terrible, dreadful, awful, abysmal product!\" will have fpos == 0.0 (0/10) and fneg == 0.6 (6/10). Alternatively we could decide to discount all \"stop words\": these are extremely common words such as \"this\", \"is\" or \"a\", which are required by the syntax of the English language but don't really carry semantic meaning. If we strip out these three words, we have fpos == 0.857 (6/7) in the first example, and fneg == 0.857 in the second example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing down all positive and negative words in the English language by hand would be a very long and tedious task. Thankfully we don't have to do this ourselves, since it was already done by Hu and Liu (https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html).

Notice that the Hu-Liu lexicon contains different word forms: for example, it contains both adjectives (\"wholesome\") and adverbs (\"harshly\"), and verbs appear both in the base form (\"blurt\") and in inflected forms (\"picketing\"). It also contains common misspellings (\"flicering\" instead of \"flickering\").

    "We are now ready to train our first predictor! Generally it's a good idea to keep it simple at the beginning, so we'll start with a method you will probably remember from high school: linear regression (also known as least-squares regression). If you haven't studied the mathematics before or would like to refresh your memory, there are many good materials on the Internet, e.g. on Khanacademy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data Otherwise you can also use the Python libraries as a \"black box\" - this will be sufficient if you don't plan on working with data a lot.\n",

    "Later this week we'll learn how to use Google's Tensorflow library to train a linear regression model: however, that will be mostly for pedagogical purposes, and would be a bit of an overkill in practice. The Scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has very good implementations of classical predictors such as linear regression:"
