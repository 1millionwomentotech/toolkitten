# 1 Million Women To Tech - Summer of Code - Week 4 Hackathon Challenge

The challenge is to build a sentiment analyzer using the Amazong Review Dataset - (Baby category)[http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Baby_5.json.gz]

Bonus:
- You get bonuses if your sentiment analyzer is also predictive of the (Apps for Android)[http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Apps_for_Android_5.json.gz] category, as we will be prototyping and writing our own apps during Week 7 and 8 during the #SummerOfCode

Data is from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
