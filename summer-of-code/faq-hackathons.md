##Hackathon FAQs

###Is participating in the Hackathons mandatory?

We just wanted to remind you that participating in the Hackathons is not mandatory! Please continue to focus on the lessons and the homework if you're a beginner or feeling a little overwhelmed and go at your own pace Make sure to challenge yourselves though, don't be afraid - you'll learn best this way! If the lesson content covers things you already know, then the Hackathon challenges are a great way to practice your skills and have fun! 

###I’m new to programming. Should I participate in the hackathons?
The learning curve is quite steep if you are new to programming.  The info that the hackathons are not mandatory and are not even recommendable for total beginners. 

The pace in the lessons is fast enough and looks really fast as the topics are the same as a 4 month Intro to Programming course for Python. Hackathons are usually formatted for users who already have the knowledge and like to figure out how to implement and take their programming skills further.  

Just understanding how to deconstruct problems and convert them into code is hard enough for a beginner with no knowledge on how the computer handles data.


###Is it possible to change the Hackathon submission deadline to Sunday?
No answer as of yet; timeframes:

Code Freeze Fridays: 09:00am code freeze, all coding homework, projects, hackathon submissions must be complete 09:00am - 12:00pm noon Judges deliberation 12:00 pm announcement of winners
this is on the toolkitten general info; is there any way to do a code freeze at 9:00 pm Friday?


###If we'll late with homework and hackathon, what will happen?
𝙈𝙤𝙮𝙧𝙖𝙞 ᴳᴼᴸᴰ- 19-08-18 14:43
We have the full 12 months to submit homework so don't feel the pressure! However hackathons are due before the code freeze on friday 9am BST

###Do we have any infrastructure to create groups for hackathons yet?
Like a google form to connect people based on time zone and perhaps outside interests or something like that?
𝙈𝙤𝙮𝙧𝙖𝙞 ᴳᴼᴸᴰ-19-08-18 14:38
Nah, most people have just been asking people if they wanna group up in this channel or some of the general channels

###Is there any guide to upload the hackathon files? 
I am a little bit confused with Github, no idea where and how to upload

I tried to find a guide, but I only found naming convention for the file: https://github.com/1millionwomentotech/toolkitten/blob/master/summer-of-code/week-01/wk1-hackathon-submissions/hackathon.md 
Easiest way to submit is to go here and create new file: https://github.com/1millionwomentotech/toolkitten/tree/master/summer-of-code/week-01/wk1-hackathon-submissions And make a pull request with a new file. This is a quick workaround for actually using git so please try to do it this way, and for next upload try to learn from some git guide how to use your own fork on github

Ilona explained this in day 3's teaser video
the idea is to create a helpdesk ticket in the member portal, so don't go to Github
if you create a pull request in Github, it will show up for everyone, and they have created a private repo so we won't see each other’s answers

###??Really more GIT, but applicable: How to upload your solution to GIT
You just need to traverse to toolkitten/summer-of-code/week-01/wk1-homework-submission inside your text-editor and make a file named soc01hw-Smruti_Shah.py Code inside it 
After that you should be ready to push your changes and Generate a PR


###I am a DIY student and I don't see the Hackathon tab in my portal.
May I know how to participate in hackathon?
For DIY it is a nice and challenging exercise, so you do not need to upload your code (other mentors: feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!) If you're working in a team on the challenge, there is a folder in GitHub, where you can upload your code so you can work together
If I missed the a hackathon can I join the next one?
