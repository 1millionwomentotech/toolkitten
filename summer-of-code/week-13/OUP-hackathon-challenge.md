# 1 Million WomenTo Tech OUP React Challenge

## Challenge

Oxford University Press makes information about its content and products available in a variety of ways that make programmatic interaction possible.  In this challenge we would like you to work with one of the below format options and develop a user interface in React to display and navigate through the content.

## RSS
OUP publishes a range of RSS feeds and in the zip file associated with this challenge are two examples:
1)  An example from the journal Brain providing details about the content from the latest issue (Brain_Journal.xml).
2)  An example of the latest products from OUP related to Computer Science (Computer_science_New_Products.xml)

## JSON
The Oxford Dictionaries API (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) offers a free tier (up to 3,000 requests a month) for access to OUP’s dictionary content.  Responses are in JSON and you should consult the documentation  https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation for more information on Terms and Conditions and how to make requests to the API.

You should work with one of the above sources (i.e. either of the RSS examples or the Dictionaries JSON API) and using it build your user interface to present the information it makes available.

When submitting your work please send:
1)  A link to a public version control repository containing your code,
2)  The URL to the hosted and running version of your submission,
3)  Your name


## Judging Criteria 

There are a number of criteria that OUP will use to judge the winner of the challenge, these are:
Quality of the code: 
* Efficiency of the code / understanding of the framework.
* Well commented and readable.
* Evidence of tests in place to validate functionality.
* The performance (speed and usability) of the user interface for end users.
