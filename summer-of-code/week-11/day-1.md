## Week 11 Augmented reality

## Day 1 - Image tracker

### Introdution

We are going to use Vuforia -  Wiki definition *It is a machine vision engine that usecognize and track planar images (Image Targets) and simple 3D objects, such as boxes, in real time. This image registration capability enables developers to position and orient virtual objects, such as 3D models and other media, in relation to real world images when they are viewed through the camera of a mobile device*


### Get ready
We'll continue working with Unity3D, be sure you have your developer tools properly configured for andrioid/iOS build.
* Get your developer account at https://developer.vuforia.com/vui/auth/register

#### AR Unity packages - Advanced
* **Hololens Mixed reality toolkit:** https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity
* **Magic Leap:** Right now is only available in the US but developers can download the emulator at https://unity3d.com/es/partners/magicleap
* **ARcore:** https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk
* **ARKit:** https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-arkit-plugin-92515

### How does Vuforia work?

Unlike ARcore or the ARkit vuforia doesnt track

* A guide to design AR markers: https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/Optimizing-Target-Detection-and-Tracking-Stability

### Generating our image-based marker

### Making our marker even better

You can play , colors and contrast until you get something you are happy with

### Prefabs
We can pack objects as prefabs so that we can instantiate them later.

### Vuforia on the scene
Every vuforia application needs to validate its licence on the server before runnig. We can get a free developing licence at the developers portal 

* The image target that we uploaded was processed by the engine and its features were extracted, now is ready to be imported as a unity package
