## Week 11 Augmented reality

## Day 2 -   Trigger interaction

Today we will learn:

* How to trigger events when 2 AR-traslated objects overlap
* How to create UI interaction (tap and text input)  for mobile apps 
* How to connect scenes


### Trigger setup

When working with 2 or more targets, the sizes are important
A pairing of 2 objects, one has to be the trigger and have a rigidbody inside (Kinematic).

### Trigger states recognition.
Triggers dont involve physics collisions. They just recognize when two objects are overlaping

* You can trigger events in the object that owns the script or on the other collider.
* **OnTriggerEnter** is called when the other Collider enters the trigger.
* **OnTriggerExit** is called when the  other Collider has stopped touching the trigger.
* **OnTriggerStay** is called almost all the frames for every  other Collider  that is touching the trigger. The function is on the physics timer so it won't necessarily run every frame.

When a trigger collision is recognized we can call any function that we want through scripting.


### Creating an UI-only screen

* Create a screenspace camera and add a sprite renderer to cover all of the camera view. Even without implementing the AR camera prefab, when using Vuforia, the AR behaviour will be forced in all scenes.
* Play around inserting Buttons, input fields, images etc.



### Navigating through scenes


```csharp
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
///:.....................//

public void LoadMyScene(string scenename){
		SceneManager.LoadScene (scenename);
	}
```
To test event *Loadscene manager*, the scenes must be added in the build setting
