## Summer of Code


## Homeworks Day 1

- [ ] Install all the Tools . Get a simple app running on your device or emulator
- [ ] Create design of 5 figures minimum in tinkerCAD, at least 2 of them to be a character with legs and arms. Explore all the available basic shapes and challange your creativity 
- [ ] Import the models into your scene and place them around the camera object 
- [ ] Explore resources in the Unity  asset store


## Homeworks Day 2

- [ ] In your project you should have 5 objects. Implement a several cinematics examples on them, and customize them so that each one would have a different bevhaviour (one would rotate around a specific axis, other would translate, or scale in some direction.
- [ ] We can also store and access the amount of distance covered by a translation since the beginning of the app, create some thresholds so that after your model has moved Xm it starts returning to is original position.
- [ ] optional : Explore the Unity documentation function https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.FromToRotation.html, and create a unity script that makes all objects look in the direction of the camera at all time.


## Homeworks Day 3

- [ ] Create a canvas with at least one panel, one image, and two buttons, for each of your 3D objects. The panel should include a name for your model and the authors name/Allias :)  after triggering the first button the text should change to a background story of your model (description, inspiration,etc). The second button should change to say something like "Please enjoy the next art-work"

- [ ] Create another button in your canvas that will trigger your model to be affected by gravity, rotate and bounce 2 times , instead of these actions being triggerd by the users view. (Disable previous script or change the raycast one) Include restrictions, please don't let them fall.

## Homeworks Day 4

- [ ] Create an animation for  each one of your models that will only start when the user gazes at a "ANimate" Button inside the panel that you already created. For the character models, each body-part must have a different movement. :) Be creative and have fun

- [ ] Create animations and an animator controller for the camera object and trigger each animation to move around our 3D models museum and interact with the panels when the Maximum reticle distance is not big enought to reach them as they are far away.
