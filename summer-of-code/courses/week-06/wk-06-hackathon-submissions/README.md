### Setup and Run Instructions

This submission contains the following files:
- `boggle_solver.html`: HTML file to display results of the Boggle solver challenge
- `main.js`: program entry point to get the boggle solver started
- `solver.js`: script that implements a boggle game solver
- `board.js`: script that randomly generates a boggle board
- `dictionary.js`: script to implement the boggle dictionary using a trie
- `trienode.js`: a javascript class that represents a trie node
- `dictionary.txt`: the dictionary text file used for this project

**To run the program:**
- Download and unzip the `soc6h-bs-al-ll-sug.zip` file.
- From a command line window, navigate to the (newly unzipped) `soc6h-bs-al-ll-sug` folder.
- Launch the application by opening the `boggle_solver.html` file in **Firefox**.

**Note**:

> Due to **security reasons**, Chrome, by default, does not allow for local files to be loaded and read in Javascript.
Therefore, loading our dictionary from a local text file won't work in Chrome. 
Which is why, we recommend running the Boggle solver in Firefox.

> There's, however, an option to disable the security configuration in Chrome. 
[Here][9] is an article that explains how it can be done on a Windows or a Linux machine.
