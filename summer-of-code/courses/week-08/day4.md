## Invision Studio desktop app

As it is in early release and unstable, it is not recommended to use.

Even if you are able to create animations, those will be lost when you upload to the Invision web or the mobile app.

## Final words

Hope you are inspired to prototype your own app idea and start getting feedback from users. There are many problems that are worth solving and you can make your own life and those around you better by using your creativity. As Einstein said (according to the internet, so it must be true!) "Creativity is intelligence having fun."

Have fun!
