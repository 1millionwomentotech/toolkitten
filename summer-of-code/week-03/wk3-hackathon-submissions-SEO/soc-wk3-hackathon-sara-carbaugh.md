# 1MWTT SEO and Content Marketing Strategy

Purpose: To reach women and enbies who have dreams of finding a career in tech.

Through online research and group discussion we have discovered that there is no shortage of "learn to code" programs for women. Many programs have long histories and large communities that help them get the word out to women and enbies that coding is a wonderful and rewarding career. Unfortunately there seems to be a lack of education past the "learn to code" chapter.

We have created an outline and implementation guide that will do two things:

1. Help grow traffic to the 1 Million Women to Tech website and programs through SEO keywords and content creation
2. Set up a __Career Enrichment Program__ that will encourage and mentor women who have the coding skills but need the experience and guidance to break into the job market.
