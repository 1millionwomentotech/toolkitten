As with all #SummerOfCode courses this course can be taken any time. It is self-contained 4 day course aimed to be completed over a time period of 1 week to 1 month.

The minimum time suggested is 2 hours per day: 1 hour to watch the lecture and 1 hour to "tinker". However, if you have more time, you are given resources so that you can do this course as a full immersion: 8, 10 or even more hours per day ;). Just make sure you take good care of yourself. Hydrate often and exercise!

Let's get started. Before we dive head first into making an app it may make sense to talk a little bit about design. After all, if you don't know where you are going, it's hard to get there.

## Lifecycle

Web and mobile apps go through stages before the final product gets into the app store and into the hands of the users. Roughly speaking we can identify the following steps:
- prototype
- review
- iterate
- manage
- test web and mobile apps
