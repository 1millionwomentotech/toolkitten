#Boggle is a 4x4 word game with 16 dice.
#
#Points are given in the following way:
#1 and 2 letter words = 0 points 
#3 letter words = 1 point 
#4 letter words = 2 points 
#5 letter words = 3 points
#(length of the word above 2)
#The longest possible word 16 letter word = 14 points
#
#When you build a word, you can only use one letter once: in other words,
#if you travel along the board and you used a letter, 
#you cannot use it again for the same word, however, you CAN use it for a new word.
#
#You can travel in any direction on the board, diagonal travel is allowed.
#
#The person with the most points win.
#
#Challenge: write a boggle solver that finds all possible words on a given board. 
#You should pick a fixed vocabulary (dictionary): Hasbro standard English dictionary
#
#Bonuses:
#fastest algorithm
#choose dictionary
#choose dice distribution
#extend to 3x3 and 5x5
#benchmark
#What is the MOST number of points possible in boggle? 
#That is, what is the holy grail of Boggle with a fixed dictionary?
