# 1 Million Women To Tech

## Summer of Code

### Week 2 

### Day 4


#### Modules

Modules are just files that hold code. They must have the `.py` extension.


```
  File "day4.py", line 3, in <module>
    to_eng(5)
NameError: name 'to_eng' is not defined
```

- `import` 
- renaming modules `as`
- built-in modules
- dir()
- `from`

We use the `import` keyword to gain access to functions and variables from other modules.
