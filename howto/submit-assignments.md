# 1 Million Women To Tech (1MWTT)

## Submitting assignments for SOC2018 #HOWTO

If you have previously submitted SOC HW through Github, please visit https://github.com/1mwtt-soc1 and check whether your homework is visisble. If it is, you do not have to resubmit :)

Otherwise, please follow the instructions below;

* Click on the respective week's assignment link and accept the assignment

* Wait for a couple of minutes - a new branch called 'develop' should appear. Do your work in this branch

* When you are ready to submit, create a pull request from the *develop* branch into the *master* branch.

* A 'to-review' tag will be added to the repo, letting us know that your homework is ready to be corrected.

* Once you have submitted, a mentor will review your homework by submitting a Pull Request Review;
  * If you have met all the requirements of the homework, the mentor will 'approve' your homework - Congratulations!
  * If you have not met all the requirements, the mentor will 'request changes' and give helpful comments on what you need to do to satisfy all the requirements. Do not worry! In the workplace it is common to go back and forth 4-5 times with Pull Requests and Pull Request Reviews before your code will be accepted and merged in. Once you have made the required changes, **reopen the pull request**.


> Notes: 
> - Sometimes there may be issues during branch creation, especially if there was an error or hold up during the creation of the repo by Github Classrooms. If the 'develop' branch does not appear within 15 minutes, please create and work on your own branch. **Please do not commit directly to master branch.**
> - If you face issues in committing directly to the 'master' branch, do not worry, this is to be expected. The bot protects the master branch to help trigger assignment events in the future. Please work on the 'develop' branch.
> - Please do not fork your private repository as an issue with the Github API causes a functionality of the bot to fail for pull requests from a fork.
> - If the 'to-review' tag does not appear after submission then please contact support. Remember to refresh the page a few times first.
