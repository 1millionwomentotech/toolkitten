  - 2.1. https://discord.gg/uFess3g 
  - 2.2. Choose username: and add the [xyz mentor] postfix e.g. JamieAwesome[blockchain,python mentor]
  - 2.3. Once on the inside, issue the following command to the mentor ranks, and our moderators will upgrade you to have the `@Mentor` permissions:

### What kind of mentors are you looking for?

We are looking for passionate volunteers who are fluent in English and have expert knowledge in at least one of the following areas: JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, or Blockchain. Furthermore, since most of our participants are completely new to coding, it would be great if you were a person who is kind, patient, and positive in the feedback you provide! All genders are welcome to mentor, although we want to particularly encourage women and enbies.

A small handful of learners however have had 5, 10, or 20 years in software engineering and are looking for advanced code reviews so if you are algorithmically strong please put that in your username as a prefix e.g. JamieBond[algo mentor]

### What can I get out of it?

Most importantly, the opportunity to be part of something great and make a difference! We are absolutely overwhelmed by much interest the 1 Million Women To Tech: Summer of Code has received so far, with over 20,000 pre-registrations from over 145 different countries all around the world. Since we are a non-profit and this is our first Summer of Code, unfortunately, we will not be able to accept all of these candidates, as much as we would like to. The more mentors are willing to contribute, the more women will be able to receive personalized guidance on their journey into coding: therefore the project stands and falls with your support! We believe that this is an exciting opportunity to make a difference and start bridging the gender gap in the tech sector! 

You will also receive a Leadership Certificate from Oxford Entrepreneurs, and be able to put a really cool item on your CV!

### How much time do I need to commit?

We ask for 10 hours minimum in total, however it can be at any time that you are available and it can be done remtely. (If you can do even more than one week, we will be extremely grateful!) You can select which times of the day work best for you: as our participants come from all around the world, someone will be online and needing help all around the clock.

When checking your availability, we recommend that you also make sure that your skill set matches the Summer of Code programme in the week when you are planning to volunteer:

### What exactly does “mentoring” entail?

We ask you to be available on the 1millionwomentotech Discord chat server for answering participants’ questions about the current week’s syllabus and coding challenges across the following channels.

Discord : #Gold and #VIP channels on Discord  support channel and answer questions in real time via chat. Some advanced learners will ask you to give them a full code review or help with defining or implementing their hackathon challenge.

GitHub Classrooms: We operate a GitHub classroom where the participants can send Pull Request, which we will ask the mentors to review. 

StackOverflow: Additionally we will create a special hashtag for participants asking coding questions on StackOverflow, and we will ask some of our mentors to watch out for these tags and take care of the questions.

If you have prior experience mentoring in hackathons or courses, especially in online environments, we would welcome your ideas, suggestions, or even your help coordinating the mentoring process.

### What is your onboarding process?

We offered a webinar on Sunday, July 8, 4 pm BST (15:00 UTC) to everybody who expresses their interest to mentor. We would ask all prospective mentors to watch this webinar (ideally live, or later via replay). After watching this webinar, you will then be invited to our slack channel where we will discuss all the details. Get good headphones and a webcam please so when you Mentor, you can hop onto pair programming calls easily.
