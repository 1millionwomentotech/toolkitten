# 1 Million Women To Tech - HOWTO Contribute

## Start:
1. Fork
2. Clone

## Each time:
1. Pull
2. Resolve conflicts, if any
3. Add/edit, save
4. Stage
5. Commit - add commit message
6. Push
7. Open Pull Request
8. Make requested changes, save, stage, commit, push -> repeat until there are no more change requests from the maintainers. Important: there's NO need to open new pull requests as you push your updates. The hole PR workflow is centered around this idea that new commits you push will be added to the same open PR until it is ready to be merged in.

Done! Your Pull Request is accepted and merged!

## Conventions:
- Leave exactly one empty line at the end of every file.
- Folder names are all small caps, spaces are done with dashes `-`
- Commit messages are small caps, starting with English present tense verbs e.g. `add`
- Run a spell checker/linter before you commit
