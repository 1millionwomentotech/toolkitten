Thank you!

> Notes:
> - Many HW assignments were submitted during SOC2018 before the bot was created and the required workflow enforced. 
>   - If there are no open pull requests, please check the closed pull requests. (For instance, some learners created a pull request and merged the changes). Continue to open the closed pull request and submit your review.
>   - If there are no pull requests at all.. (For instance, some learners committed directly to master). Please create an issue requesting them to submit a pull request for their homework.
