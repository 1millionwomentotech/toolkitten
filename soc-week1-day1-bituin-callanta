#The Curriculum-exercises are:

#Write a program that tells you the following:
#Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?

print ( 'There are', 24 * 365, 'hours in a year')

#Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?

print ('There are', 60 * 24 * 365 * 10, 'minutes in a decade')

#Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)

print ('I am', 33 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60, 'seconds old')

#•    Andreea Visanoiu: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha. Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.

print ('Andreea is', 48618000/365/24/60/60, 'years old')

#Here are some tougher questions:
#•    How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?


#•    How about a 64-bit system?

#•    Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules.

from datetime import date
age = date.today()-date(1985,5,29)
print(age.year)
