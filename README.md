5th Annual Oxford Inspires Conference

Oxford Inspires, the student entrepreneurship conference of the year is a weekend-long annual conference running from July 14th to July 15th, held at the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford. The theme of this year’s conference is “Diversity and Tech”, and we will be hosting speakers discussing the recent developments within the technology sector, and their interactions with diversity. 

On the Saturday we will be hosting a Facebook Developer Circle Community Challenge Build Day. People can either bring their own hacking, or join in with our #1millionwomentotech Social Impact hackathon, building software applications including the Toolkitten chatbot, which bring the world closer together. The best project at the end of the day will win a special prize! Participate in building an extraordinary community concerned with social development.

On the Sunday, we will be hosting a Social Entrepreneurship workshop called zerO2Ownership #O2O for those who have a brilliant idea, but who require specialist advice to make it a reality. We will cover how to develop a business model, a financial plan, how to apply for funding, and how to hire the best team possible. Strengthen your pitch deck, meet like-minded Entrepreneurs, and receive tailored advice to help make your dream a reality.
